        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Hello there! I’m a passionate designer looking for an inspiring opportunity that not only allows me to
            expand my skills but also contribute meaningfully. I thrive in collaborative environments, relishing the
            chance to tackle challenges alongside a team.

            <p>Beyond the world of design, I love animals, exploring interesting color palettes, indulging in delicious
                cuisines, discovering new beverages, and enjoying good music.</p>
